## üöÄ Features
- **Fully Responsive:** This web app was created under the *mobile-first*  concept. Responsive web design is a web design method that enables web to fit the screens of different devices automatically, displaying the content in a way that people feel comfortable. This greatly reduces users‚Äô operations like panning, zooming and scrolling when browsing the web. *Mobile first*, as the name suggests, means that I started the product design from the mobile end which has more restrictions, then expand its features to create a tablet or desktop version.

- **Multi-language support**: This web app has multi-language support, based on the client's navigator language. Basically, all text strings are functions that return strings based on key codes given as parameters on these funcions, that reads from locale files based on the client's navigator language.
